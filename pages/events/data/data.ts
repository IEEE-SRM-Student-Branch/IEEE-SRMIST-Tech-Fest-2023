      "Everyone is given the same word, but one person is given a slightly different word, known as the \"Important Artist\" word. Each player takes turns describing their word with a single word, while trying to avoid giving away their secret identity as the Imposter Artist player. The other players must use their detective skills to figure out who has the different word, and vote on who they think the Imposter Artist player is. Will you be able to fool your friends and uncover who is Imposter Artist?\n\nSetup: Gather a group of players (ideally 4 to 10 players for a good balance of interaction and difficulty). Press the 'Start Game' button at the top of this page. This will assign all players with their secret words.",
